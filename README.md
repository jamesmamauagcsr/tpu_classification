# Flower Classification with TPUs

## Use TPUs to classify 104 types of flowers

Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are Now Available on Kaggle
Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) quotas are now available on Kaggle, at no cost to you!

TPUs are powerful hardware accelerators specialized in deep learning tasks. They were developed (and first used) by Google to process large image databases, such as extracting all the text from Street View. This competition is designed for you to give TPUs a try.

The latest Tensorflow release (TF 2.1) was focused on TPUs and they’re now supported both through the Keras high-level API and at a lower level, in models using a custom training loop.

We can’t wait to see how your solutions are accelerated by TPUs!

The Challenge
It’s difficult to fathom just how vast and diverse our natural world is.

There are over 5,000 species of mammals, 10,000 species of birds, 30,000 species of fish – and astonishingly, over 400,000 different types of flowers.

In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that identifies the type of flowers in a dataset of images (for simplicity, we’re sticking to just over 100 types).
